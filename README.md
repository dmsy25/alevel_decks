# alevel_decks
OCR Biology, AQA Chemistry, Edexcel Mathematics AS + A Level decks from Summer 2023

The decks are arranged by tags, rather than decks. To study a particular section of the syllabus, you can just to a custom study and 'Choose by card state or tag' and then either 'New/Due' and then check the box with 'include these tags' and pick the ones you want.

The tags are arranged by modules in the science decks, and the maths ones are just scattered around.

The science decks include lots of short exam questions from a range of boards and IAL boards

Known Issues:

CHEMISTRY: Some drawn mechanisms may have spelling errors (eg, _neutrophilic_ rather than _nucleophilic_). These are present in the images themselves so they're not easy to fix.

Please raise any issues you find and I will sort them out as soon as I can.
